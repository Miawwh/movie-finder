# 🎬 Movie Finder

A simple and beginner-friendly project that allows users to search for their favorite movies by typing the title into an input field. For example, if a user types `naruto`, the app will display search results for movies with the title *Naruto*.

This mini project was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap 5**, and **JavaScript**, with the help of the **Axios** library for fetching movie data from an API.
